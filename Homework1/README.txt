-Basic ray tracer program.

This folder contains sample scene files in XML format and their
expected outputs. These are stored in "hw1_sample_scenes" and
"hw1_sample_outputs" folders, respectively.

The source codes demonstrate how you can read an XML file and
save your output image in PPM format.

Just type "make all" and it should produce an executable called "raytracer"

An example usage is shown below:
    ./raytracer hw1_sample_scenes/simple.xml test_pattern.ppm
